    "abstract": "<p>This talk explores notions of identity and teacher identity, how these relate to the specific characteristics of language teaching, and how teacher identity can evolve or be developed through experience and teacher education. The notion of teacher identity stresses the individual characteristics of the teacher and how these are integrated with the possibilities and potentials provided in the institutional identity of teacher and the content and methods of a specific field, as these are realized in specific contexts of teaching. The elements of a teacher identity in language teaching are derived from a review of literature on teacher identity and described in terms of the foundational and advanced competences required for language teaching, as illustrated by excerpts from teacher narratives. The paper concludes with recommendations for teacher education and professional development with a focus on identity.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>There are two ways of thinking about course evaluation. One is the dominant approach in educational planning that considers evaluation as a set of activities to develop efficient and effective ways of achieving learning outcomes. The rigor with which course development is carried out – drawing on procedures that include needs analysis, planning learning outcomes, designing a course and syllabus framework, and using effective methods of teaching and learning – will determine the success of the outcomes. Curriculum processes are seen as ways of bringing order, control, and direction into language teaching and language course design. From this perspective, evaluation is viewed as essential to maintaining the quality and success of a language program.</p><p>The alternative approach to evaluation can be described as process evaluation and focuses more on the values that the curriculum reflects and how the curriculum is realized through the procedures and activities of teaching and learning. From this perspective, evaluation has very different goals. Its goal is exploration and understanding. This view of evaluation is inquiry-based and is concerned with knowledge building, with understanding, and with explanation. The goal is less diagnoses and improvement and more on a holistic exploration of teaching in context.. This is a sociocultural approach to evaluation in which classrooms are seen to have a rich life that unfolds over time, as events and processes interact and shape the way participants think, feel, and act.</p><p>Both approaches to evaluation will be described and compared in this paper: effectiveness-oriented evaluation which will be characterized as <strong>product-focused evaluation</strong>, and the alternative approach as <strong>process-focused evaluation.</strong></p>",

The data consisted of two individual interviews with four pre-service teachers and researchers’ two classroom observations. Study findings indicated that the four pre-service teachers’ self-efficacy was generally improved after having participated in ESL microteaching experiences because it enhanced pedagogical knowledge and provided more opportunities to evaluate their knowledge through microteaching practices. However, pre-service teachers’ self-efficacy varied depending on ELLs’ diverse English proficiency, home languages, and previous teaching and working experiences with ELLs. This study provides several suggestions about how teacher educators can create a purposeful ESL microteaching experience for teacher candidates in the teacher education program.",

Combine that with second language learning in English, it can be a challenge to motivate students to read. In this interactive presentation and workshop, I will talk about my strategies for getting students to be interested and active in their learning English through engaging activities and lessons that are fun and meaningful. Activities include close reading and analysis, activities with a ball and reading aloud, using a word wall and storyboard, and memorization of key sentences to be spoken aloud. In addition, I will go into the research-based strategies that help students increase in their literacy level.

Pen-to-paper writing tasks are necessary, but cumbersome. How can we spark motivation, capture minds, and allow for a sense of fun? In reality, options abound all around us.  Drawing on more than 12 years of EFL writing class experience, this presentation encourages the teaching of writing using anything but traditional writing itself. Memes, videos, puzzles, music, podcasts, comics, games, and social media can all punctuate a writing lesson in a lighthearted, memorable (yet still useful) way.

Through this study, students are guided to motivate themselves to learn English well through SDT. Furthermore, some practical suggestions are given to teachers.

Then, we will look at what an English teacher working at one of these rural elementary schools can do to help compensate for the constraints encountered, and also explore the affordances this particular teaching environment offers.

Students are motivated by many factors such as curriculum, organization of class, and management.

My “iceberg” theory proposes that student motivation is subconsciously influenced by teacher’s passion, enthusiasm, charisma, and positive attitude. Who the teacher is and what the teacher does in and outside of class both influence the learning and motivating process. The teacher therefore must assume many roles to motivate students with high levels of approving, encouraging, and inspiring. The second part of this workshop will explore several practical “sharing and caring” techniques, building rapport, relational reciprocity, and interpersonal activities that have worked in my classes over the last 10 years.",

This project explores the role that task-based curriculum plays on literacy development to better equip second language (L2) English speakers who are living in a non-English speaking country to advance to English language high school and university. The presentation focuses the development of a curriculum with task-based learning activities that supports the vocabulary development of elementary Korean English language learners using Greek root words and affixes beyond vocabulary word lists. The curriculum uses grapheme, phoneme, morpheme awareness, integrated in a way that helps students understand how words are built. Students  find meaning of unknown words by breaking the word down into its parts as well as analyzing the context of the text. My guiding question is this: How will the use of task-based learning activities affect the reading and writing literacy of elementary Korean English language learners? I hope that educators find that the units offer a new perspective to ELL vocabulary acquisition that accesses and builds on background knowledge leading to higher comprehension.  KEYWORDS: Greek affixes, root words, task based instruction, guided reading, essential questions, literature circles, reader’s theater, activating background information, higher order thinking, language interactions, vocabulary development",

Furthermore, Ooiwa-Yoshizawa (2012) argues, critical EFL educators ought to highlight changing norms in English language usage, as well as heighten student awareness of marginalized populations’ lived experiences through classroom activities. DeWaelsche (2015) echoes these sentiments, finding that Korean university students will successfully overcome perceived socio-cultural limitations to critical dialogue, thereby developing critical thinking skills. Participants in this workshop will explore the meaning and impact of critical language pedagogy, and explore ways to use it in their classrooms.",

    "abstract": "A notable trend in recent literature is the emerging evidence of the transformative power of teacher-led ELT research on the professional development of teachers, especially because of the context-specific nature of the research.
