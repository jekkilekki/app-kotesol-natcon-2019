    "abstract": "<p>This talk explores notions of identity and teacher identity, how these relate to the specific characteristics of language teaching, and how teacher identity can evolve or be developed through experience and teacher education. The notion of teacher identity stresses the individual characteristics of the teacher and how these are integrated with the possibilities and potentials provided in the institutional identity of teacher and the content and methods of a specific field, as these are realized in specific contexts of teaching. The elements of a teacher identity in language teaching are derived from a review of literature on teacher identity and described in terms of the foundational and advanced competences required for language teaching, as illustrated by excerpts from teacher narratives. The paper concludes with recommendations for teacher education and professional development with a focus on identity.</p>",
